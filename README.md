zfsmond ZFS Monitor
===================

zfsmond is a script that scrapes information from `zfs` and `zpool` on Solaris 
boxes and pushes that information to a web service (in /webapp) that \[will eventually\]
provide a nice interface to monitor multiple pools and mounts and their constituent devices.
